## Introduction
- We wanted to design a photo gallery that would make the image look more unique and beautiful. 
- This webpage was design base on our hobby for photography. We looked into some of the amazing places in tulsa, that have some beautiful views to take pictures.
- The idea was also to give the people who are new to oklahoma, places to visit, enjoy and take picture. 
- The idea of the project is to welcome those who enjoy photography to be able to view pictures in a unique gallery.
